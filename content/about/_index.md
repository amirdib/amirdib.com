I completed a PhD at ENS Paris-Saclay under the supervision of Nicolas VAYATIS and Mathilde MOUGEOT titled _High dimensional pattern learning for symbolic time-series_. My research focused on ML model for symbolic time series classification applied to anomaly detection. It covers related problem in statistical learning theory, bayesian inference and pattern extraction. The [thesis manuscript](thesis_manuscript.pdf) and the [PhD defense' slides](phd_defense_slides.pdf) are available online.
